# my first homework
I completely removed the <div> elements and replaced them with semantic elements, 
so the code has a more structured (less cluttered) look to it. 
Removing the <div> elements did provide a problem since the CSS links had to be changed as well. 
I also added alt tags to all of the pictures to provide a description of them.
